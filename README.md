# A Chat Client App

Hey!! This is a Chat Client that I made as a practice project during Quarantine to refresh my Node.js Skills.

* Uses Socket.io on top of Express.js for real time client to client communication
* Frontend built using Materialize.css and jQuery

I loved making this xD

## How to Run?
1. Clone the Repository into your computer.
2. Open a Terminal in the Repository folder.
3. You'll need to install all the dependencies to run the project. Execute `npm install`
4. Then, after the dependencies are install, run `npm start` to run the project.
5. Navigate to 127.0.0.1:3000 to see the output.

Thanks for being here <3
