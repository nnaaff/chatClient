# A Chat Client App

Hey!! This is a Chat Client that I made as a practice project during Quarantine to refresh my Node.js Skills.

* Uses Socket.io on top of Express.js for real time client to client communication
* Used MongoDB hosted on Mlab to store the messages
* Frontend built using Materialize.css and jQuery
* Tests written using Jasmine Testing Framework

I loved making this xD

## How to Run?
1. Clone the Repository into your computer.
2. Open a Terminal in the Repository folder.
3. You'll need to install all the dependencies to run the project. Execute `npm install`
4. Please Make sure you replace the user credentials in the server.js file for MongoDB with yours. The Project will not execute as I have left the space `YOUR MLAB USERNAME` and `YOUR MLAB PASSWORD`.
5. Then, after the dependencies are installed, please make sure you install `nodemon` into your sytem using `npm install -g nodemon`. Then, run `npm start` to run the project.
6. Navigate to 127.0.0.1:3000 to see the output.
7. You can also run the tests using `npm test`

Thanks for being here <3
